Just got outta the theater after watching Wolf Man, and I feel like my brain and my soul took a walk through quicksand — slow, sticky, kind of leaving me wondering why I even stepped in at all. Was I supposed to enjoy it? Get scared? Laugh, maybe? I mean, you walk in expecting a face full of fur and fangs, right? But somehow, it felt more like a lukewarm bath. Like, not a relaxing one, just the kind you take when the water heater’s broken.

The Wolf Man himself kinda reminded me of my uncle Norman who drinks too much at family gatherings — hairy, grumpy, but ultimately harmless. I mean, honestly, at some point it looked like he tried stealing hair mousse from a 90s metalhead. The transformation scene? Less werewolf, more awkward puberty video. Like, we get it, movie guy, fur's sprouting everywhere. We've all been there.

> The lighting. Why so dark? I swear it felt like they filmed it inside a giant sock. Could barely see who was who. Maybe that was the point? Can't be a horror if nobody sees it coming, or, you know, sees it at all. An auditory experience in pitch-black confusion. Just close your eyes, you'll miss nothing.

The storyline kinda fell over itself like a puppy with oversized paws. Started strong, then just slid around wildly with no direction. I found myself rooting for the innocent hiker in scene three — mostly ‘cause he had no idea what he was walking into, much like me downloading the movie in the first place. And the music! Oh lord, as if someone dropped a bassoon into a blender and called it a soundtrack. 

Speaking of walking, why do these cursed characters always run towards the eerie howling sounds? If I hear a growl in the woods, I'm taking the direct opposite direction, thank you very much! But who am I to judge, I suppose if you're in a horror movie, logic is left at the popcorn counter.

```csharp
public bool IsFurGrowing(int moonPhase)
{
    return moonPhase == FULL_MOON;
}
```

I tell ya, might just need to watch the movie again to catch what I missed... or fell asleep through. It’s like staring at those magic eye posters — is it a sailboat or just a bunch of random nonsense? Who knows! Anyway, walking out of that theater and into the chilled air was the best part. A much needed breeze on fur-fatigued senses.
